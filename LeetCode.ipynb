    "    You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.\n",

    "    Example 1:\n",
    "    Input\n",
    "    [\"MyQueue\", \"push\", \"push\", \"peek\", \"pop\", \"empty\"]\n",
    "    [[], [1], [2], [], [], []]\n",

    "    Explanation\n",
    "    MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();\n",
    "    myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]\n",
    "    myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)\n",

    "    1 <= x <= 9\n",
    "    At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.\n",
    "    All the calls to pop and peek are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer."
